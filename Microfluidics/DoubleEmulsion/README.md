### Development of Ultra-Lightweight and Functionalized 3D Printing Resins

[Functional soft materials and methods of making and using thereof - US11460356B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11460356B2/en)

#### Part 1. 3D Modeling of Microfluidic Devices
I designed a series of microfluidic devices in SOLIDWORKS for use in microsphere production. These devices are cost-effective and aid in rapid prototyping, and were vital in the development of functionalized 3D printing resins.
